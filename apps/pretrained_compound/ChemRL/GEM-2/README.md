# GEM-2: Next Generation Molecular Property Prediction Network with Many-body and Full-range Interaction Modeling
GEM-2 is a molecular modeling framework which comprehensively considers full-range many-body interactions in molecules. Multiple tracks are utilized to model the full-range interactions between the many-bodies with different orders, and a novel axial attention mechanism is designed to approximate the full-range interaction modeling with much lower computational cost.
A preprint version of our work can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05863).

</p>

The overall framework of GEM-2. First, a molecule is described by the representations of many-bodies of multiple orders. Then, Optimus blocks are designed to update the representations. Each Optimus block contains $M$ tracks, and the $m$-th track contains a stack of many-body axial attentions to model the full-range interactions between the $m$-bodies. The many-body axial attentions and the Low2High module also play the roles of exchanging messages across the tracks. Finally, the molecular property prediction is made by pooling over the $1$-body representations.

# Usage

Firstly, download or clone the lastest github repository:

    git clone https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleHelix.git
    git checkout dev
    cd apps/pretrained_compound/ChemRL/GEM-2

# Data
You can download the PCQM4Mv2 dataset from ogb website: 
    
    https://dgl-data.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/dataset/OGB-LSC/pcqm4m-v2.zip

# Processed Data
You can download the processed PCQM4Mv2 dataset with rdkit generated 3d information from:
    https://baidu-nlp.bj.bcebos.com/PaddleHelix/datasets/compound_datasets/pcqm4mv2_gem2.tgz
And then use tar to unzip the data.
```bash
  mkdir -p ../data
  tar xzf pcqm4mv2_gem2.tgz -C ../data
```

# How to run
## Introduction to related configs
You can adjsut the json files in the config folder to  change the training settings.
### dataset_config
- `data_dir`: where the data located
- `task_names`: the name of the label column in the datafile

### model_config
- `model`: model related information, like the channel size, dropout
- `data`: data transform setting



### train_config
- `lr`: learning rate
- `warmup_step`: the step to warm up learning rate to lr
- `mid_step`: steps before learning rate decay

## Start training 

    sh scripts/train.sh

The models will be saved under `./model`.

It will take around 60 mintues to finish one epoch on 16 A100 cards with total batch size of 512.

## Run inference
To reproduce the result from the ogb leaderboard, you can download the checkponit from:
    https://baidu-nlp.bj.bcebos.com/PaddleHelix/models/molecular_modeling/gem2_l12_c256.pdparams
Then put it under the local `./model` folder and run the inference command:
    sh scripts/inference.sh
